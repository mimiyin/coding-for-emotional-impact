Coding For Emotional Impact
===========================
This class is for anyone trying to use code to tell a story, compose music, or embue a physical object with the power of emotional expression. We will be looking at examples from a broad array of media and disciplines from the column structure of Greek temples to music (classical and contemporary) to poetry to paintings to story-driven video games and yes Youtube "cat" videos. 

You will be working from code examples and simple interfaces I will create to help you play with different computational techniques. Our aim isn't to invent fancy new algorithms. Instead we're using computation and programming as a tool to help us decode the mechanisms that drive compelling emotional arcs.
More details to come! [Full description.](#full)

## Syllabus (Work-in Progress)
###Week 1: Seeing, Hearing, Sensing, Feeling Through the Lens of Patterns
- What is narrative arc? What is composition? What are its basic building blocks?
- What does it mean to compose narrative arc computationally?
- What is a pattern? When does a pattern cease to be a pattern?
- Can patterns be emotional?
- [Notes](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Week-1)

####Homework 1: Create your own human "chamber music" piece.
- Duration: **1-7 minutes**
- Collect 5-6 patterns from the "real world" to contribute to your group. They can be images, sound, video clips, objects, etc. Document your patterns in your blog post and write 1-2 sentences on the emotional impact of each pattern.

##### HW 6: Due Sun Mar 23th | [Post to HW Wiki](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Homework)
- [Online Metronome](http://a.bestmetronome.com/)

##### Play with timing and pacing.

1. Pacing  or Tempo: How quickly is the pattern repeating?
2. Timing: Ways to think about timing...
 - When does the pattern change? 
 - When does order turn into chaos turn into order?
 - How long do you have to do one thing, for the next thing to be surprising?
 - How big is the change?

##### Approaches you can take if you’re stuck.
 1. Decode a video clip or piece of music you love.
 2. Code one of the patterns we decoded in class. (Notes coming soon.)
 3. Revisit something you’ve done and tighten the timing and pacing to bring it closer to the emotional arc you’re going for.
 
##### Be prepared to talk about:
 1. What tempos you used (in beats-per-minute).
 2. What are the effects of the timing and pacing choices you made (e.g. building suspense, calming effect, fake-out, disorientation) 

Here’s a [basic timing control example using frameCount](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%206-7%20Timing%20and%20Pacing/framecount)

### Week 7: Expressing Timing and Pacing as Curve Functions
- Playing with the rate of change as a curve
- Linear versus geometric versus exponential growth.
- [Notes](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Week-7)

##### HW 7  Due Sun Mar 30th | [Post to HW Wiki](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Homework)
- Play with timing curves.

### Week 8,9: Pulling It All Together
- A polyphonic model for composing narrative and emotional arc. | [Notes](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Week-8)
- Scoring for Momentous Occasions and Catastrophic Events

#### HW 8 Due Sun Apr 7 | [Post to HW Wiki](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Homework)
- For all options, write 1-2 sentences describing the narrative you're going for.
Option 1: Use the keyboard and mouse to create compositions out of the examples from class.
- Goal is honing compositional skills using the knobs and dials of turning voices on and off and controlling their wave patterns.	
- Make a storm. | [Code](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%208-9%20Polyphonic/Storm)
- Make the circle dance. | [Code](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%208-9%20Polyphonic/Circle)
- Make a poem. | [Flash-y version](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%208-9%20Polyphonic/Jabberwocky) | [Timed version](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%208-9%20Polyphonic/Jabberwocky_Long)
- Record your composition with screen capture. 
- Record the keyboard interactions you used to create your composition, like a score so someone else could repeat it.

Option 2: Customize the examples from class.
- Replace the storm code with your own classes: Make a farmyard, make a galaxy, make a dance party of monsters.
- Change up the circle, turn it into a rectangle or hook it up to one of your previous sketches.
- Change the array of strings to create a "poem" with your own content. Use the numbers coming out of the Voice objects to control a different aspect of the words: 
- e.g. alpha to fade the words in and out 
- e.g. relative ordering of the words in space
- e.g. spell the words out one letter at a time and use the voices to control how many letters to spell out
- e.g. whatever other crazy thing you can think of!

Option 3: Roll your own. Create your own polyphonic compositions from scratch.
- Check out [Chorus](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/tree/master/Week%208-9%20Polyphonic/Chorus) for an example of how to make the voices change and turn on and off on auto-pilot (requires [SoundCipher](http://explodingart.com/soundcipher/))
- 
#### HW 9 Due Mon Apr 21 | [Post to HW Wiki](https://github.com/mimiyin/coding-for-emotional-impact/wiki/Homework)
- Create something polyphonic
- Prepare a 5 minute presentation for your final project proposal including:
 - Title
 - Environment: A description of the physical environment. 
 - Audience: A description of the person who's experiencing your composition.
 - Narrative arc: Provide a verbal description as well as graphs.

### Week 10: Present proposal final project

### Week 11: 8 of you will present works-in-progress
- Aaron, Wyna, Kate, Laura, Susane, Federico, Ken, Alejandro

- Show something working! 
 - What have you tried? 
 - What did you user test? What were the results? 
 - Show a couple of iterations of the work you’ve done. What works about them? What doesn’t?
- What’s next?
 - What are you going to try next?
 - What do you think you’ll have by the end of the 2nd week?
- Any questions for the class?
 - Technical: How should I approach…
 - Conceptual: What’s more effective…
- Please be sure to post documentation of your progress to the HW Wiki so we can zip through your work  in a lightning round at the end of class. We’ll have about 5 minutes to spend on each person.

### Week 12: 8 of you will present final projects
- Neva, Karam, Zoe, Aankit, Michelle, Sagar, Sam, Regina

#### Presentation Guidelines
- Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation.
- Demo what you’ve done!
- Walk us through your narrative. What are your favorite parts. What’s not quite right yet?
- Tell us how you did it! Visual aids, diagrams are always helpful.
- How’d you get here? Did you user test? What did you try? What did you throw away, what did you keep? Show us earlier iterations.
- Those of you who presented last week, please post a link to video documentation of your final so we can do a round of rapid-fire viewing at the end of class.

## Class Description
Coming out of nowhere. Monotonous drone. Running out of steam. Pregnant pause. Unbearable build up in tension. Gratifying resolution. We use these phrases all the time to describe music and film, animation and dialogue. We strive to provoke these reactions when we compose a piece of music or author a story.

What are we actually talking about? Narrative and emotional arc and its more abstract cousin, composition.

But what does it mean to compose a story or a piece of music in terms of rules and patterns expressed in code? In this class, we will look at how to use simple computational strategies to compose patterns of events capable of producing emotional impact. 

The class is agnostic to medium. "Narrative events" can be shifts in color in a painting, shifts in meter in music or shifts in the emotional state of the protagonist of an interactive story. You define the events. The class provides the techniques for shaping those events in dynamic ways over time.

The class is also as much an exercise in cultivating personal sensitivity to the emotional power of patterns as it is a class in how to write code to generate such patterns. We will devote as much time to collecting and dissecting compelling examples of composition as we do to writing code. 

Assignments will alternate between programming exercises done in Processing and more creative assignments applying newly learned techniques to the medium of your choice, in the programming language of your choice. Since this is as much a course about perception as it is about code, user testing your creations will be as important as the creations themselves!
